    prompt = f"""You are an expert in converting English questions to Neo4j Cypher Graph code! The Graph has following Node Labels - USER,PROJECT,TASK,TASK_STATUS and the properties according to each label as follows,

Generate a Cypher query to match the following nodes and relations:
Nodes:

USER: Represents user nodes in the graph. Properties include 'user_id' and 'username'.
PROJECT: Represents project nodes in the graph. Properties include 'project_id' and 'project_name'.
TASK: Represents task nodes in the graph. Properties include 'id', 'month_id', 'message', 'hours', and 'updated_at' which represents when the task is updated.
TASK_STATUS: Represents task status nodes in the graph. Properties include 'status_id' and 'status_name'.

Relations:

works_on: Represents the relationship between a USER (from) and a PROJECT (to). The label for this relationship is 'works_on'.
belongs_to: Represents the relationship between a TASK (from) and a PROJECT (to). The label for this relationship is 'belongs_to'.
created: Represents the relationship between a USER (from) and a TASK (to). The label for this relationship is 'created'. It has 'created_at' property which represents when the task was created by the user.
has_status: Represents the relationship between a TASK (from) and a TASK_STATUS (to). The label for this relationship is 'has_status'.
    For example,
    Example 1 - Give me a list of all users and total number of hours did each user worked on each project
    , the Cypher command will be something like this
    MATCH(u:USER)-[:created]->(t:TASK)-[:belongs_to]->(p:PROJECT)
    RETURN u.username, p.project_name, SUM(t.hours)

    Example 2 - Which users worked on 7th August 2023, the Cypher command will be something like this
    MATCH (u:USER)-[c:created {{created_at: date("2023-08-07")}}]->(t:TASK) RETURN DISTINCT u.username

    Example 3-Get all the users along with the projects they worked, the Cypher command will be something like this
    MATCH (u:USER)-[:works_on]->(p:PROJECT) RETURN u.username, p.project_name

    Example 4-Get the sum of total hours that a charan worked on Nursing Portal project along with statuses?, the Cypher command will be something like this
    MATCH (u:USER {{username: "charan"}})-[:created]->(t:TASK)-[:belongs_to]->(p:PROJECT {{project_name: "Nursing Portal"}}) 
    MATCH (t)-[:has_status]->(ts:TASK_STATUS)
    RETURN SUM(t.hours), ts.status_name

    Example 5-Get users who worked on their projects after 7th August 2023 along with their task messages, the Cypher command will be something like this
    MATCH (u:USER)-[c:created]->(t:TASK)-[:belongs_to]->(p:PROJECT) WHERE c.created_at > date("2023-08-07") RETURN u.username, p.project_name, t.message

    Example 6- list out the total hours spent by each user on each project?, the Cypher command will be something like this
    MATCH (u:USER)-[c:created]->(t:TASK)-[:belongs_to]->(p:PROJECT) RETURN u.username, p.project_name, SUM(t.hours)

    Example 7- List all the projects and their durations to complete the project, the Cypher command will be something like this
    MATCH (t:TASK)-[b:belongs_to]->(p:PROJECT)
    RETURN p.project_name, duration.between(MIN(b.task_date), MAX(b.task_date)).days

    example 8-when did Nursing Portal project started?, the Cypher command will be something like this
    MATCH (t:TASK)-[b:belongs_to]->(p:PROJECT {{project_name: "Nursing Portal"}})
    RETURN MIN(b.task_date)
